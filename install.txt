You need libusb installed with headers.  On Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev

You need to make sure the USB HID driver in Linux doesn't bind to
the Luxafor.  To do that, on Ubuntu, create a file named
/etc/modprobe.d/luxafor.conf with contents of:
    options usbhid quirks=0x04d8:0xf372:0x0004

You also need to ensure that the udev subsystem allows you to access the
Luxafor without root access.  To do that on Ubuntu, create a file as
/etc/udev/rules.d/luxafor.rules with the following content, changing
"jmaslak" to whatever your username is.
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTR{idProduct}=="f372" MODE="0664", OWNER="jmaslak"

For Google calendar integration (optional), you'll need gcalcli
installed.  on Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install gcalcli

Then you'll want to run gcalcli the first time, and log into Google with
your proper credentials:
    gcalcli agenda

You need relatively recent Raku to be installed. Download Raku for your OS
from:
    https://www.raku.org/

Once Raku is installed, as root, you can install this package with:
    zef install BusyIndicator

Now you can run the script using "busy-indicator-raku" from the command
line!
